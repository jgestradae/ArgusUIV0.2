The AI engineer effectively addressed critical issues and advanced feature development for the ArgusUI application. Initially, a persistent Leaflet hot-reload bug in  was diagnosed as a React StrictMode conflict and resolved by disabling StrictMode in . Subsequently, remote login failures were fixed by correctly configuring  in the frontend's  file to the server's IP. A major effort was directed at fixing AMM XML generation, which involved extensive refactoring of  and  to match ORM specifications, correcting backend Pydantic models (changing  to  for MongoDB compatibility), and aligning frontend data structures. The file watcher's Python 3.13 compatibility issue with  was also resolved by suggesting an upgrade. The scheduler's startup was fixed to ensure AMM XMLs are processed. Most recently, the AMM wizard was updated to display Signal Path instead of Device, and a GSP request endpoint was integrated.

<product_requirements>
The ArgusUI web application interfaces with the R&S Argus spectrum monitoring system via an XML interface, replacing desktop access. It uses React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database). Key features include Automatic Mode (AMM) for scheduling measurements, System Status via ORM GSS/GSP, Data Navigator for results, Direct Measurement, Configuration, Authentication (admin/operator, AD/LDAP), and a Geolocation Map for station visualization. The application must generate XML requests to Argus's inbox and parse responses from the outbox. Recent additions focus on enhancing AMM with detailed timing, measurement, and station selection, and developing the Geolocation Map. The user also requests ping-based station health checks, SNMP integration roadmap, and user login logs.

    -   **Changes:** 's  and  were changed from  to  for MongoDB compatibility.  was updated to use  instead of .
-   ****: AMM scheduling logic.
    -   **Changes:** Scheduler startup was added to 's .  was updated to correctly map frontend data, including  and , to XML parameters.  updated to use OR prefix.
-   ****: Core data models.
    -   **Changes:** Verified  enum already included GSP.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on addressing the AMM (Automatic Mode) module, which recently achieved successful configuration creation but failed to generate the XML file in the Argus inbox. The user also noted that the AMM wizard is displaying device info instead of signal path info despite previous attempts to fix this, and that a GSP (Get System Parameters) request should be made at the beginning to populate signal path information for the AMM wizard. The AI engineer has just finished adding a GSP endpoint and parsing logic, and is currently analyzing the newly provided GSP order and response XML examples to understand why the AMM XML is not being generated in the inbox and to refine the GSP-derived information usage for AMM.
