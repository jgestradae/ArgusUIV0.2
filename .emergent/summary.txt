The AI engineer's work on ArgusUI progressed through several critical phases. Initially, a Plotly.js module error was resolved, followed by the implementation of a comprehensive System Logs module. Significant effort was then dedicated to achieving Accessibility and Usability Compliance (NTC 5854 / WCAG 2.1 AA / G.SIS.04 / GEL), including i18n, high contrast mode, screen reader support, and semantic HTML, with several dependency and rendering fixes. Subsequently, the ORM-ADC Direct Measurement module was implemented for real-time UDP data capture and XML order generation. The most recent phase involved implementing DF/TDOA location measurements in AMM and Direct Modes, along with Active Directory (LDAP) authentication. A key security requirement for AD involved encrypting configuration parameters in MongoDB via a frontend interface. Throughout, the AI engineer demonstrated iterative development, robust debugging, and consistent user communication, especially in addressing local environment issues and ensuring feature completeness. The current task is to make the left menu scrollable.

The ArgusUI application provides a web interface for R&S Argus, handling XML-based communication. It initially supported GSP integration, AMM XML fixes, measurement processing, and an AMM calendar. Recent enhancements included advanced data visualization (1D, 2D spectrogram, 3D surface plots), an AMM wizard with a Result Type step, and live data display in the Data Navigator with plot markers. A major focus was Accessibility and Usability Compliance (NTC 5854 / WCAG 2.1 AA / G.SIS.04 / GEL), incorporating i18n, high contrast, screen reader mode, and semantic HTML. The ORM-ADC Direct Measurement module was implemented for generating XML orders to Argus's INBOX and capturing real-time UDP 4090 measurement data, with WebSocket-based frontend visualization. Latest requirements involved integrating DF (Direction Finding) and TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) measurements across AMM and Direct Measurement modes, including specific visualization options (spreadsheet, polar, map with bearings/hyperbolas). Additionally, Active Directory (LDAP) authentication was to be integrated, maintaining local authentication fallback. A crucial update mandated encrypted storage of AD configuration from a frontend interface.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work focused on enhancing the Active Directory (AD) authentication module. The user requested that AD configuration information (IP, domain, port, user group) should not be stored as an open file but rather in an encrypted manner via an interface.

The AI engineer implemented the following:
1.  **Backend Encryption Utility ():** A new module was created to handle the encryption and decryption of sensitive AD configuration data. This involved installing the  Python library.
2.  **AD API Update ():** The AD API was extended with new FastAPI endpoints to facilitate saving and updating the encrypted AD configuration in MongoDB.
3.  **Auth AD Update ():** The  was modified to retrieve AD configuration from this encrypted MongoDB storage instead of relying solely on  file variables.
4.  **Server Integration ():** The main FastAPI  was updated to correctly pass the  instance to the  during initialization, enabling database access for configuration.
5.  **Frontend AD Configuration UI ():** The frontend component was significantly refactored to include a user interface allowing administrators to input, save, and update AD connection parameters. These parameters are then encrypted by the backend and stored in MongoDB. The UI also displays the current AD connection status.

The backend is successfully running with the new encrypted AD configuration setup, and the frontend AD Configuration page is loading correctly, allowing for configuration management.

The very last request from the user was: I want to ask you to implement a little modification in the left menu bar to make it scroll because right now when the screen is very small, I cannot see all the options.
